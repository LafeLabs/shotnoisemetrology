<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
    The purpose of this project is to improve the signal to noise ratio for all RF measurements in the quantum information community.  Because the scaleability of quantum computing is dependent on qubit fidelity, which in turn is dependent on RF noise level, this is a critical parameter in all superconducting qubits.  To accomplish this task, much time and money has been poured into technologies like superconducting amplifiers, circulators and other measurement tools. 
</p> 
<p>
     While such technologies have indeed proven useful, investigation into the actual noise floor of quantum measurement experiments with shot noise tunnel junctions has shown that noise levels are not as they seem.  Losses, reflections, and subtle combinations of the two often conspire to make noise levels considerably higher than their nominal value based on the stated noise level of both the exotic quantum amplifiers now being deployed and the various commercial semiconducting amplifiers that are used to follow them. 
</p>
<p>
    This presents a problem for anyone hoping to move the overall field forward.  Money spent on both equipment and research and development for new measurement tools can get squandered when distributed across the whole QC community, based on lossy coaxial cables, multiple reflections from small impedance mismatches, and so on.  The purpose of shot noise tunnel junction metrology is thus not just to prove that it works and test some amplifiers.  It is to create a pattern of information flow across the whole field which enables all researchers to get a better handle on the losses and reflections in their measurements and then eliminiate those issues to bring their noise levels down to where they can be based on the technology available.  
</p>
<p>The information flow of this system can be summarized as follows.  Joe Aumentado at NIST in Boulder has perfected the fabrication processes and a system for packaging the tunnel junctions with a good enclosure and circuit board, and the first step in using this system is acquiring a device from Joe.  Once a lab has a packaged device they need to integrate it into their measurement system in a way that gives an accurate picture of their whole measurement chain.  To do this, the shot noise junction is inserted into the system in a place that is as close as possible to where the sample will be in the quantum information measurement which is the ultimate goal of the lab.   This chain must be meticulously documented if this is to be useful, and for it to be of value to the community at large that documentation should be shared online.  
</p>
<p>
    With the device installed, the fridge is cooled down, with data being taken during the cool down.  When cold, noise is measured on a spectrum analyzer in zero span mode while voltage on the tunnel junction is swept at audio rates.  This measurement should be as consistent as possible throughout the quantum information community, and should be shared in a way where everyone is comparing data in an almost identical format.  Thus the information being shared is a combination of diagrams which detail the exact nature of the full measurement chain from device to rack and plots of a standardized measurement which anyone with basic lab tools should be able to do in an identical way.  This combined shared data stream allows all participants in the quantum information field to observe in real time what works and what doesn't and to improve the <em>overall</em> quantum measurement efficiency of the field.
