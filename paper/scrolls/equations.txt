<h4>Equations and Definitions</h4>

<p>
    The most general equation for shot noise junction measurements is:
</p>

 $$
 P = G\left\{T_N + \frac{1}{2}T\left[
 
 \left(\frac{eV + hf}{2kT}\right)\coth{\left(\frac{eV + hf}{2kT}\right)}   +
 \left(\frac{eV - hf}{2kT}\right)\coth{\left(\frac{eV - hf}{2kT}\right)}   
 
 \right]\right\},
 $$
 
 
 <p>
     where $T_N$ is the noise temperature to be defined below, T is the physical temperature, f is the frequency of the measurement, k is the Boltzman constant, h is Plank's constant, and G is gain in units of integrated measured power per kelvin.  
 </p>
 <p>
     The definition of G here and the use of total integrated power units is a key element to making sense of these experiments in the lab.  The standard equations in the literature express
