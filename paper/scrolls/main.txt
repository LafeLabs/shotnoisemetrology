List of stuff to do:

<ul>
    <li>
     Edit Joe's document to make it less informal, make it fit better into overall document, add details about installation to cohere with what I've written already.    
    </li>
    <li>
        Measurement section needs a figure showing how it all goes together, a figure with example fit, and detailed fitting instructions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Final social section needs figures for each step that exists, and detailed description of each software unit.
    </li>
    <li>need a script to put it all into one pdf document with a click</li>
    <li>need a reader at index.php which can read all the scrolls, switch between them.</li>
</ul>
